flask-backbone-todo
===================

This project takes the [TodoMVC project](http://todomvc.com/architecture-examples/backbone/) with Backbone.js and gives it a Flask backend instead of using local storage. It also uses simple user authentication to seperate a user's Todo list from other users.
